# Practical-Private-Logs

Now is a good time to sanitize logs of behavioural data.
This is a collection of pointers to software and guidance on how to do that.

For the batch setting, i.e you have a bunch of historical files you would like to delete, and you would like to preserve something in their place which 

(1) does not leak much information 
(2) is useful
